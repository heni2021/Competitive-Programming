Logic:- In question it is given that 1 stick + 1 coal = 1 torch. Hence we need k coals in order to make k torches.
Equation : ((k*y)+k-1)/(x-1) -> will give you number of trades require for coals because in each trade you will gain x-1 sticks. Now if the answer is in decimal then add one to the trades other wise directly add k to the answer.

TIME COMPLEXITY: O(1)
SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)

JAVA CODE:-
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Solution
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int test = sc.nextInt();
        for(int g=0;g<test;g++)
        {
            long x = sc.nextLong();
            long y = sc.nextLong();
            long k = sc.nextLong();
            long sticks = k*y;
            sticks+=k;
            sticks-=1;
            long total = (long)sticks/(x-1);
            long other = sticks%(x-1);
            if(other!=0)
            total++;
            System.out.println(total+k);
        }
    }
}
